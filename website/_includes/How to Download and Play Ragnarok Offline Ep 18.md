In this article, we will show you how to download and play Ragnarok Offline Ep 18 in a few simple steps. You will need a Windows PC with Visual Studio installed, as well as some basic knowledge of how to compile and run a game server. Let's get started!
 
## Step 1: Download Ragnarok Offline Ep 18
 
The first step is to download the game files from a reliable source. There are many websites that offer Ragnarok Offline downloads, but some of them might be outdated, incomplete, or infected with malware. We recommend using the link below, which is from a YouTube video by Finnp [^2^], a Ragnarok enthusiast who provides tutorials and guides for the game. The link will take you to a Google Drive folder where you can download the game files as a ZIP archive.

The ZIP archive contains three folders: Client, Server, and Tools. You will need to extract them to your desired location on your PC. For example, you can extract them to C:\RagnarokOffline.
 
## Step 2: Compile and Run the Server
 
The next step is to compile and run the server files that will allow you to play the game offline. You will need Visual Studio for this step, which is a free software development tool that you can download from Microsoft's website.
 
[Download Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
 
Once you have installed Visual Studio, open it and go to File > Open > Project/Solution. Navigate to the Server folder that you extracted earlier and open the solution file called rAthena.sln. This will load the server project in Visual Studio.
 
Next, go to Build > Build Solution. This will compile the server files and generate executable files in the Server\bin folder. You will need to run these files in order to start the server.
 
First, run login-server.exe, then char-server.exe, and finally map-server.exe. You should see three windows with some messages indicating that the server is running. Do not close these windows while playing the game.
 
## Step 3: Configure and Run the Client
 
The last step is to configure and run the client files that will allow you to access the game interface and create your character. You will need to edit some files in the Client folder that you extracted earlier.
 
First, open setup.exe and choose your screen resolution, graphics quality, sound options, and language. You can also enable full screen mode if you prefer.
 
Next, open data.ini and make sure that it contains the following lines:

    [Data]
    0=adata.grf
    1=sdata.grf
    2=data.grf

This will ensure that the client loads the correct data files for the game.
 
Finally, open clientinfo.xml and change the address value to 127.0.0.1. This will tell the client to connect to your local server instead of an online one.

    <clientinfo>
        <connection>
            <address>127.0.0.1</address>
            <port>6900</port>
            <version>55</version>
            <langtype>12</langtype>
        </connection>
    </clientinfo>

Now you are ready to play! Run Ragnarok.exe and enjoy!
